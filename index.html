                <h3>Launch</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>The launch vehicle consisted of an S-I first stage, an S-IV second stage, and an instrument unit. The
                    spacecraft consisted of a boilerplate command and service module, a launch escape system, and a
                    service
                    module/launch vehicle adapter (BP-16). The Pegasus 1 satellite was enclosed within the service
                    module,
                    attached to the S-IV stage. The orbital configuration consisted of the satellite mounted on the
                    adapter,
                    which remained attached to the instrument unit and the expended S-IV stage.
                    The vehicle was launched from Cape Kennedy Launch Complex 37B at 09:37:03 a.m. EST (14:37:03 GMT) on
                    February 16, 1965. A hold of 1 hour and 7 minutes was caused by a power failure in the Eastern Test
                    Range flight safety computer. A built-in hold of 30 minutes was also used to discharge and recharge
                    a
                    battery in the Pegasus satellite as a check that it was functioning properly.
                    The launch was normal, and the spacecraft was inserted into orbit approximately 10.5 minutes after
                    launch. The launch escape system was jettisoned during launch and the command module was jettisoned
                    after orbital insertion. The Pegasus satellite weighed approximately 3980 pounds (1805 kg) and was
                    208
                    by 84 by 95 inches (5.28 by 2.13 by 2.41 m). The width of the deployed wings was 96 feet (29.3 m).
                    The
                    total mass placed in orbit was 33,895 pounds (15,375 kg). The perigee was 307.8 miles (495 km), the
                    apogee was 461.9 miles (743 km), and the orbital inclination was 31.76°.

                <h3>Results</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>The trajectory and space-fixed velocity were very nearly as planned. The Apollo shroud separated from
                    the
                    Pegasus satellite about 804 seconds after lift-off, and deployment of two meteoroid detection panel
                    wings of the Pegasus satellite commenced about 1 minute later. The predicted useful lifetime of
                    Pegasus
                    A in orbit was 1188 days. The satellite was commanded off (decommissioned) on August 29, 1968.
                    Although
                    minor malfunctions occurred in both the launch vehicle and the Pegasus A satellite, mission AS-103
                    was a
                    success in that all objectives were met. The spacecraft remained in orbit until July 10, 1985, when
                    it
                    re-entered the atmosphere and landed in the ocean.

                <h2> Saturn I SA-1 </h2>
                <p>the eighth Saturn I flight, lifted off from LC-37B on February 16, 1965. This was the first Saturn
                    with

                <h3>Objectives</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>The Saturn I booster was a huge increase in size and power over anything previously launched. It was
                    three times taller, required six times more fuel and produced ten times more thrust than the
                    Jupiter-C rocket that had launched the first American satellite, Explorer 1, into orbit in 1958.

                    At the time, NASA had decided to not use all-up testing, when an entire system is tested at once.
                    The agency planned to test each rocket stage in separate launches, so for SA-1 the only live stage
                    was the S-I first stage.

                    This first flight was designed to test the structure of the launch vehicle during a suborbital
                    flight using the nose cone from a Jupiter rocket.
                </p>
                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>At 12:30 p.m. EST on October 27, 1961, the RP-1 propellant started to flow into the rocket. A slight
                    surplus (3%)[2] of the fuel required was put into the rocket, as it was possible to easily drain
                    fuel. Just before launch, surplus fuel was removed from the tanks.

                    Liquid oxygen began flowing into its tanks at 3:00 a.m. the next day. It followed the same procedure
                    as the RP-1 with the tanks being filled to 10 percent to check for leaks, then fast filled to 97
                    percent, then slowly topped off.

                    Despite a couple of delays due to bad weather, the rocket was launched only one hour behind
                    schedule. The engineers had given the rocket only a 75 percent chance of lifting off and only a 30
                    percent chance of completing a nominal flight. Even with a nominal flight some damage was thought
                    possible. At the Redstone Arsenal, ground testing had shattered windows 12 km away.

                    The sound of the launch was a disappointment for some witnesses, being described as like an Atlas
                    rocket launch, when observers stood 1.5 miles (2.4 km) away instead of three miles (5 km) for a
                    Saturn launch. It was later determined that the cause of the difference between the Cape and the
                    Redstone Arsenal was atmospheric conditions damping the sound.

                    The flight itself was nearly perfect. The rocket reached a height of 136.5 km and impacted 345.7 km
                    down range from the launch site in the Atlantic Ocean.[3] The only real problem was the rocket cut
                    off 1.6 seconds ahead of schedule. This was traced to the fact that there was 400 kg too much liquid
                    oxygen and 410 kg too little RP-1. For the test flight, SA-1 only carried a propellant load that was
                    83 percent full.
